# chisel

Chisel is a fast TCP tunnel, transported over HTTP. Single executable including both client and server. Written in Go (Golang). Chisel is mainly useful for passing through firewalls, though it can also be used to provide a secure endpoint into your network. Chisel is very similar to [crowbar](https://github.com/q3k/crowbar) though achieves **much** higher [performance](#performance). **Warning** Chisel is currently beta software.

### Install
aa
**Binaries**

See [the latest release](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel/releases/latest)

**Docker**

```sh
docker run --rm -it jpillora/chisel --help
```

**Source**

``` sh
$ go get -v github.com/jpillora/chisel
```

### Features

* Easy to use
* [Performant](#performance)*
* [Encrypted connections](#security) using `crypto/ssh`
* [Authenticated connections](#authentication); authenticated client connections with a users config file, authenticated server connections with fingerprint matching.
* Client auto-reconnects with [exponential backoff](https://github.com/jpillora/backoff)
* Client can create multiple tunnel endpoints over one TCP connection
* Server optionally doubles as a [reverse proxy](http://golang.org/pkg/net/http/httputil/#NewSingleHostReverseProxy)

### Demo

A [demo app](https://chisel-demo.herokuapp.com) on Heroku is running this `chisel server`:

``` sh
$ chisel server --port $PORT --proxy http://example.com
# listens on $PORT, proxy web requests to 'http://example.com'
```

This demo app is also running a [simple file server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve) on `:3000`, which is normally inaccessible due to Heroku's firewall. However, if we tunnel in with:

``` sh
$ chisel client https://chisel-demo.herokuapp.com 3000
# connects to 'https://chisel-demo.herokuapp.com',
# tunnels your localhost:3000 to the server's localhost:3000
```

and then visit [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/), we should see a directory listing of the demo app's root. Also, if we visit the [demo app](https://chisel-demo.herokuapp.com) in the browser we should hit the server's default proxy and see a copy of [example.com](http://example.com).

### Usage

<tmpl,code: chisel --help>
```

	Usage: chisel [command] [--help]

	Version: 0.0.0-src

	Commands:
	  server - runs chisel in server mode
	  client - runs chisel in client mode

```
</tmpl>

`chisel server --help`

<tmpl,code: chisel server --help>
```

	Usage: chisel server [options]

	Options:

	  --host, Defines the HTTP listening host – the network interface
	  (defaults to 0.0.0.0).

	  --port, Defines the HTTP listening port (defaults to 8080).

	  --key, An optional string to seed the generation of a ECDSA public
	  and private key pair. All commications will be secured using this
	  key pair. Share this fingerprint with clients to enable detection
	  of man-in-the-middle attacks.

	  --authfile, An optional path to a users.json file. This file should
	  be an object with users defined like:
	    "<user:pass>": ["<addr-regex>","<addr-regex>"]
	    when <user> connects, their <pass> will be verified and then
	    each of the remote addresses will be compared against the list
	    of address regular expressions for a match. Addresses will
	    always come in the form "<host/ip>:<port>".

	  --proxy, Specifies the default proxy target to use when chisel
	  receives a normal HTTP request.

	  -v, Enable verbose logging

	  --help, This help text

```
</tmpl>

`chisel client --help`

<tmpl,code: chisel client --help>
```

	Usage: chisel client [options] <server> <remote> [remote] [remote] ...

	server is the URL to the chisel server.

	remotes are remote connections tunnelled through the server, each of
	which come in the form:

		<local-host>:<local-port>:<remote-host>:<remote-port>

		* remote-port is required.
		* local-port defaults to remote-port.
		* local-host defaults to 0.0.0.0 (all interfaces).
		* remote-host defaults to 0.0.0.0 (server localhost).

		example remotes

			3000
			example.com:3000
			3000:google.com:80
			192.168.0.5:3000:google.com:80

	Options:

	  --fingerprint, An optional fingerprint (server authentication)
	  string to compare against the server's public key. You may provide
	  just a prefix of the key or the entire string. Fingerprint 
	  mismatches will close the connection.

	  --auth, An optional username and password (client authentication)
	  in the form: "<user>:<pass>". These credentials are compared to
	  the credentials inside the server's --authfile.

	  --keepalive, An optional keepalive interval. Since the underlying
	  transport is HTTP, in many instances we'll be traversing through
	  proxies, often these proxies will close idle connections. You must
	  specify a time with a unit, for example '30s' or '2m'. Defaults
	  to '0s' (disabled).

	  -v, Enable verbose logging

	  --help, This help text

### Security

Encryption is always enabled. When you start up a chisel server, it will generate an in-memory ECDSA public/private key pair. The public key fingerprint will be displayed as the server starts. Instead of generating a random key, the server may optionally specify a key seed, using the `--key` option, which will be used to seed the key generation. When clients connect, they will also display the server's public key fingerprint. The client can force a particular fingerprint using the `--fingerprint` option. See the `--help` above for more information.

### Authentication

Using the `--authfile` option, the server may optionally provide a `user.json` configuration file to create a list of accepted users. The client then authenticates using the `--auth` option. See [users.json](example/users.json) for an example authentication configuration file. See the `--help` above for more information.

Internally, this is done using the *Password* authentication method provided by SSH. Learn more about `crypto/ssh` here http://blog.gopheracademy.com/go-and-ssh/.

### Performance

With [crowbar](https://github.com/q3k/crowbar), a connection is tunnelled by repeatedly querying the server with updates. This results in a large amount of HTTP and TCP connection overhead. Chisel overcomes this using WebSockets combined with [crypto/ssh](https://golang.org/x/crypto/ssh) to create hundreds of logical connections, resulting in **one** TCP connection per client.

In this simple benchmark, we have:

```
					(direct)
        .--------------->----------------.
       /    chisel         chisel         \
request--->client:2001--->server:2002---->fileserver:3000
       \                                  /
        '--> crowbar:4001--->crowbar:4002'
             client           server
```

Note, we're using an in-memory "file" server on localhost for these tests

### Known Issues

* WebSockets support is required
	* IaaS providers all will support WebSockets
		* Unless an unsupporting HTTP proxy has been forced in front of you, in which case I'd argue that you've been downgraded to PaaS.
	* PaaS providers vary in their support for WebSockets
		* Heroku has full support
		* Openshift has full support though connections are only accepted on ports 8443 and 8080
		* Google App Engine has **no** support
